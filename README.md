# Clean data assignment (week 4)

This project provides a solution to the clean data assignment (week 4).

It contains the following files:

- run_analysis.R

    The source code to generate the compact and summaried data.

- CodeBook.md

    A description about the provided datasets. It adresses the structure of the datasets as well as the cleaning and summarisation procedures.

- compact_uci_har_dataset.csv

    The compact dataset (see `CodeBook.md` for further information)

- summarised_uci_har_dataset.csv

    The summaried (tidy) dataset (see `CodeBook.md` for further information)

## Prerequirements

This project assumes that the [UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) is downloaded and extracted into the same folder as `CleanData.R`.

## Run the script

To run the transformation, simple start `run_analysis.R`.
