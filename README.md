It contains the following files:

- CleanData.R

    A description about the provided datasets. It adresses the structure of the datasets as well as the cleaning and summarisation procedures.

- tidy_uci_har_dataset.csv

    The tidy dataset (see `CodeBook.md` for further information)

- summarised_uci_har_dataset.csv

    The summaried dataset (see `CodeBook.md` for further information)
